# LIRI Bot

### Overview

<!-- In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. -->

### Before You Begin

<!-- 1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. -->

<!-- 2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer. -->

<!-- 3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

     * You'll use Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

   * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) -->
   
## Submission Guide

Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

* Include screenshots (or a GIF/Video) of the typical user flow of your application. Make sure to include the use of Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB.

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

* Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

### Instructions

<!-- 1. Navigate to the root of your project and run `npm init -y` &mdash; this will initialize a `package.json` file for your project. The `package.json` file is required for installing third party npm packages and saving their version numbers. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code after cloning your project. -->

<!-- 2. Make a `.gitignore` file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

```
node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
``` -->

<!-- 3. Make a JavaScript file named `keys.js`. -->

<!-- * Inside keys.js your file will look like this:

```js
console.log('this is loaded');

exports.spotify = {
  id: process.env.SPOTIFY_ID,
  secret: process.env.SPOTIFY_SECRET
};
``` -->

<!-- 4. Next, create a file named `.env`, add the following to it, replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:

```js
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

``` -->

<!-- * This file will be used by the `dotenv` package to set what are known as environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github &mdash; keeping our API key information private. -->

<!-- * If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own `.env` file for it to work. -->

<!-- 5. Make a file called `random.txt`.

   * Inside of `random.txt` put the following in with no extra characters or white space:

     * spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way" -->

<!-- 6. Make a JavaScript file named `liri.js`. -->

<!-- 7. At the top of the `liri.js` file, add code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:

```js
require("dotenv").config();
``` -->

<!-- 8. Add the code required to import the `keys.js` file and store it in a variable.

```js
  var keys = require("./keys.js");
``` -->
  
<!-- * You should then be able to access your keys information like so

  ```js
  var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);
  ``` -->
